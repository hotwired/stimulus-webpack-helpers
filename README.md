## Using Stimulus Webpack Helpers

Call webpack's [`require.context`](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#require-context) helper with the path to the folder containing your Stimulus controllers. Then, pass the resulting context to the `Application#load` method using the `definitionsFromContext` helper:

```js
// src/application.js
import { Application } from "@hotwired/stimulus"
import { definitionsFromContext } from "@hotwired/stimulus-webpack-helpers"

const application = Application.start()
const context = require.context("./controllers", true, /\.js$/)
application.load(definitionsFromContext(context))
window.Stimulus = application
```
